              Karl is an inspirational PT. Pushed me to my limits, to perform
              better than I could ever have expected. His experience and
              dedication is second to none. I can not recommend Karl highly
              enough

              Karl is an excellent PT, with his supportive guidance and training
              experience I achieved a loss of 20kgs in 6 months and subsequently
              obtained my personal career goal in a highly intense work
              environment. I cant recommend Karl enough!!
